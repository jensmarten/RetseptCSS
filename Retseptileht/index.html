                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
                    <li>
                        Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. 
                        Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.</li>
                    <li>
                        Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. 
                        Set everything aside.</li>
                    <li>
                        
                        Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti 
                        and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, 
                        covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. 
                        Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, 
                        as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</li>
                    <li>
                        Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, l
                        ift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. 
                        Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.</li>
                    <li>
                        Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.
                        Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, 
                        lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). 
                        You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</li>
                    <li>
                        Serve
                    </li>
                </ol>
